## Building

### Install dependencies

We use `yarn`.

```sh
yarn install
```

### Starting local dev server.

_Make sure to set up a valid .env file, as this is not checked into github!, you can use `.env.example` for the keys you will need._

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Building for production

```sh
yarn build
```
